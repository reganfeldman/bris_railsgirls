# Rails Girls

Get excited and learn to build the web!

## General
We've given you pull & push access to the site. You can basically copy an existing event page and change the details to match yours. This can be done in a separate branch, but it's ok to make changes directly to master, too. :)

There's also a bunch of things anyone can work on the Issues section. Many of them are easy, quick tasks like updating stuff.

Find a file called **event-template.html**. Copy this file and make a new one with your cityname.


## Publishing the Site
The site will be automatically published hourly through the day. Notice that the site needs to accessible all the time and all around the world. Test your changes and be careful when pushing new commits. If the site breaks or you encounter a problem, ping us on **[contact@railsgirls.com](mailto:contact@railsgirls.com)** and someone should run over to help ; )

## Updating the Event
You need to update two places.
 1. Add your city to **index.html**
 2. Add your city to **railsgirls.com/events.html**

## How to Change the Picture & Header for the Site
Add your city picture **rg-yourcityname.png**. Add it to **/images** folder.

**Steps to Show on Site**
 1. Go to **style.css**
 2. Add two lines, always replacing **'yourcityname'** with your actual city name.

<pre>.yourcityname#promo {
  padding-left:340px;
  background:url('../images/rg-yourcityname.png') no-repeat 0 10px,
                 url('../images/separator.png') no-repeat center bottom;
}
</pre>

It will take a while before the changes show, so don't panic!

## Checklist
- Did you remember to change Twitter & Facebook details?
- Did you remember to add your event to index.html and events.html?
- Did you remember to remove your event after it finished?
